    "The purpose of this exercise is to use Python to calculate camera and scene specific values.\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "After completing this exercise, the student should be able to do the following: create a Python function that uses the thin lens equation to compute either the focal length (f), where the rays are focused (b) or an object distance (g) when two of the other measurements are given.\n",

    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Explain how to calculate the angle \\theta when a and b is given in the figure below. Calculate \\theta (in degrees) when a=10 and b=3 using the function math.atan2(). Remember to import math and find out what atan2 does.\n",
